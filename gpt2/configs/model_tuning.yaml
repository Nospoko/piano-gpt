# Using defaults so it's possible to get datasets by config name
# It's awkward because to control the overrid of datasets from CLI you have to:
#   dataset=my_dataset_config
# But to control other parameters, you have to use overrides prefix:
#   overrides.run_name_suffix=myrun overrides.model.dropout=0.5
# etc.

  - dataset: medium
  - tasks: piano_medium
  - _self_

# TODO Might be better to get rid of the overrides field and treat
# this whole config as such
