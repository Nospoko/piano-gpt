# Using defaults so it's possible to get datasets by config name
# It's awkward because to control the overrid of datasets from CLI you have to:
#   dataset=my_dataset_config
# But to control other parameters, you have to use overrides prefix:
#   overrides.run_name_suffix=myrun overrides.model.dropout=0.5
# etc.
defaults:
  - dataset: small
  - tasks: top_line
  - _self_

overrides:
  run_name_suffix: tuning-${now:%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M}
  dataset: ${dataset}
  tasks: ${tasks}

  model:
    dropout: 0.1
